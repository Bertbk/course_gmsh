## Stadium

Draw the following figure representing a stadium. Please remember that GMSH (and neither you!) can draw an arc of circle with an angle greater or equal to Ï€: intermediate `Point` might be added and the half-circle should be split in (at least) two arcs.

{{<figure src="../stadium.svg"  title="Stadium">}}
